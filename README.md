## dApp Sports betting

## Introduction

The Chiliz blockchain offers the opportunity to create new experiences for sports fans beyond today's simple votes or rewards. The proposed concept is a decentralized (dApp) mobile sports engagement application combining free sports betting, fan tokens (“fan tokens”), NFT and customizable 3D avatars. The aim is to innovate by offering **new uses for fan tokens that go far beyond traditional governance and rewards**, to bring **tangible value and authentic interaction** to fans and clubs. This all-in-one platform allows fans to **betting for free** on real events, **earn points convertible into official tokens**, **participate in polls/DAOs**, **collect exclusive NFTs**, while personalizing a virtual avatar in the image of their sporting passion.

(As part of the Chiliz “Fan Token Utility Reinvented” hackathon, this project responds directly to expectations by exploring new applications of fan tokens for fan engagement and loyalty, in line with the theme of moving beyond current voting and reward systems.)\_
