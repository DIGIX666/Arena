## DApp Sports - Fan-Token-Utility

## Introduction

The Chiliz blockchain offers the opportunity to create new experiences for sports fans beyond today's simple votes or rewards. The proposed concept is a decentralized (dApp) mobile sports engagement application combining free sports betting, fan tokens (“fan tokens”), NFT and customizable 3D avatars. The aim is to innovate by offering **new uses for fan tokens that go far beyond traditional governance and rewards**, to bring **tangible value and authentic interaction** to fans and clubs. This all-in-one platform allows fans to **betting for free** on real events, **earn points convertible into official tokens**, **participate in polls/DAOs**, **collect exclusive NFTs**, while personalizing a virtual avatar in the image of their sporting passion.

(As part of the Chiliz “Fan Token Utility Reinvented” hackathon, this project responds directly to expectations by exploring new applications of fan tokens for fan engagement and loyalty, in line with the theme of moving beyond current voting and reward systems.)\_

## Contribution

For better work management, we need to create specific branches for each task and create PRs so that all members face a review before deployment in the main branch.

# Contrats Smart Contracts (POC Hackathon)
This folder contains smarts contracts for our POC.

## Structure

1.  **`contracts/ArenaNft.sol`** : Prestige and Loyalty Engine
    * **Rôle :** Manages exclusive "raffles" where the prize is a unique NFT rather than money.
    * **Innovation :** Access is reserved for the most engaged users (e.g., > 5000 Fan Points). Eligibility is securely verified on-chain via a cryptographic signature generated by our backend.
    * **Type :**  Exclusive, focused on status and collection.

## How to Run Tests
The environment is set up with Hardhat. To ensure everything works correctly:

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Run the test suite:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```
    You should see 2 passing, confirming the logic of both contracts is valid.

## Intégration avec le Frontend (Expo)

For the frontend team, here’s how to interact with these contracts:
Integration will be done via **Ethers.js**. The first step is to deploy the contracts on the **Chiliz Spicy Testnet**.

1.  **Deployment:**
    * Use the scripts `scripts/deployAll.ts` to deploy all contracts
    * `npx hardhat run scripts/deployAll.ts --network spicy`

2.  **Retrieving Addresses and ABIs:**
    * The deployment script will print the addresses of the deployed contracts in the console.
    * ABIs are located in the artifacts/contracts/ folder. You’ll need `SimpleDuel.json` and `SeasonalNFTArena.json` and `ArenaNFT.json`.

3.  **Interacting from the App:**
    * Use the addresses and ABIs to instantiate the contracts with Ethers.js.
    
        * Handling user wallet connection via WalletConnect.
        * Calling read (view) functions to display data (duel list, pot sizes)
        * Preparing and calling write functions for user actions (placing bets, claiming rewards), which will trigger a signature request in the user’s wallet.
